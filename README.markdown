# Roo Barcamp Philly 2011 Presentation

This is the sample project and slide show for my Spring Roo
presentation.  I hope you enjoy it.

Keep in mind that I'm using Spring Roo 1.2 SNAPSHOT, which means that
the final demo (of course) failed me.  I'll be fixing that and updating
the repo.

Anyone interested in Roo can purchase the MEAP of the book at

twitter at @krimple or at my techcast podcast,
